NSD Term Project
================

This is the directory to turn in the term project proposal.  To turn it in, you
need **a PR** and **an E3 entry for the PR URL**.  See
https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/22sp_nycu/schedule.html for what
should be included in the proposal and project.

The proposal accounts for 8 points out of the 40 points allocated to the term
project.  Like homework, you will need to create a PR against the ``proposal``
branch (not ``master``).  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly your
GitHub username as your working directory (``nsdhw_22sp/project/$username/``).
The hierarchy should be like::

  - nsdhw_22sp (<- repository root)
    - project
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - README.rst (<- the main proposal file)
        - ... other files for your proposal

When submitting your proposal, name the PR as ``<username>-proposal**``, e.g.,
``yungyuc-proposal-submission``.  Don't forget to put the PR URL in the E3
entry too.  You can request my review in the PR for discussions.

Presentation
============

The presentation schedule is set. If you want to change time slots, ask for the
owner of the other time slot and file a PR tagging him or her and the
instructor (@yungyuc) against the branch `master`. The other owner needs to
respond to agree the exchange in the PR. The PR subject line should start with
``[presentation]``.

Each presentation can use at most 22 minutes. Presenters may decide how to use
their time. A possible arrangement is to use 18 minutes in the presentation
itself and 4 minutes for questions and discussions. There are 3 minutes of gap
between presentations. Presenters are expected to prepare their own computer
for presentation.

.. The time for setting up the computer is included in the allotted
   presentation time.

If presenters have difficulty in preparing a computer themselves, they may seek
help from the instructor, and resolve the issue one week before their
presentation.
